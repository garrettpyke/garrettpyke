- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, @garrettpyke here!
- I'm a full-stack engineer who loves to learn. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Weber State University, but I consider that as the *end of the beginning* of my learning journey. I'm in the process of learning more about Cloud technologies (AWS, Oracle, Azure, Google, ...).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m enjoying learning more about Python & Java in Machine Learning, GoLang, Ruby and Graph DBs if I ever get the time.
