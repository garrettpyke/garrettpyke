- 👋 Hi, I’m @garrettpyke
- 👀 I’m interested in re-learning programming, computer theory, hardware engineering...and about life, the universe and everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, node.js, Python, C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something cool once I feel like my skills are back up to snuff. I haven't written any code in over 15 years!
