- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, @garrettpyke here!
- I'm a full-stack engineer who loves to learn. I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Weber State University, but I consider that as the *end of the beginning* of my learning journey. I'm in the process of learning more about Cloud technologies (AWS, Oracle, Azure, Google, Kubernetes, Terraform...).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also enjoying learning more about in Machine Learning in Python & Java, GoLang and (Graph DBs if I ever get the time).
